Data Description\n","\n","The features that we use to represent each blind submission is summarized as follows:\n","\n","  - `id_forum`: the id or forum (the two should be identical to each other for the same paper) of a paper, which is unique by paper.\n","\n","  - `title`: the title of the paper.\n","\n","  - `authorids`: a list of author_ids. This feature is reserved for cross-referencing author profiles.\n","\n","  - `authors`: a list of authors. This feature is reserved for cross-referencing external sources such as arxiv, google scholar, etc.\n","\n","  - `decision`: acceptance.\n","\n","  - `scores`: a list of scores given by paper's reviewers.\n","\n","  - `avg_score`: the average score.\n","\n","  - `confidences`: the confidence level of each reviewer when assigning the score, also being a list.\n","\n","  - `avg_confidence`: the average confidence level.\n","\n","  - `pub_cmtids`: a list of public comment ids. If a paper does not have any public comment, this field would be an empty list.\n","\n","  - `cmt_responses`: a binary/bool list, each element indicates authors' response to the corresponding public comment. *e.g.*, `[True,False,True]` means the authors have replied to the 1st and 3rd comment, but not replied to the 2nd comment. **'replied' means an official comment from authors is created, replied to the public comment, and the creation time stamp is prior to decision time.** We notice that the authors may reply to some comments by a \"general response\" or reply to the entire thread with a single response, therefore  we first collect the items of this column by a rule-based algorithm then proofread the collected items.\n","\n","  - `cmts_sentiment`: a 5-level integer list indicating whether each comment has a positive/neutral/negative sentiment. This feature requires human-labeling. Please refer to Section 2.2 for more details.\n","    - -2: negative,\n","    - -1: neutral-negative,\n","    - 0: neutral,\n","    - 1: neutral-positive,\n","    - 2: positive.\n","\n","  - `arxiv_availability`: a binary/bool list, each element indicates the availability of an arxiv-preprint (of the paper under review) at the time that the corresponding comment is created. *e.g.*, for a submission whose preprint was submitted to arxiv on 2022-11-16, and two comments were created on 2022-11-15 and 2022-11-17, then the `arxiv-availability` is `[False, True]`.\n","\n","In this study, we focus on public comments that start a new thread by their own, and leave other types of comments (*e.g.*, voluntary response to official reviews) to future studies."],"metadata":{"id":"42ngUvPhAKan"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.
